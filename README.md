### Look for your favorite song, movie or see where your favorite artist is going to play next. 

#### How to do it??

* For a song just write spotify-this-song and then the song's name. Ex: spotify-this-song Paradise. To be more precise add the artist's name too, just like this: spotify-this-song Paradise Coldplay.

* For a movie works the same but instead of spotify-this-song use movie-this. Ex: movie-this Moana. 

* For more information about where your favorite artist is going to play just use concert-this and the name of your artist or band. Ex: concert-this Maroon 5.

* To read it from an external file in this case the random.txt file just use do-what-it-says.
